  \begin{itemize}
    \item<+-> Each classifier has its strengths and weaknesses
      \begin{itemize}
        \item<+-> k-Nearest Neighbors excels in accuracy and overall recall
        \item<+-> Neural Network scores best in terms of precision and f-measure
        \item<+-> Na\"ive Bayes has extraordinary recall with respect to class "High"
      \end{itemize}
    \item<+-> Contrary to what we initially thought -- the ensemble was merely average
      \begin{itemize}
        \item<+-> Always among the best
        \item<+-> Never reached top spot in any category
      \end{itemize}
        		\item<+-> How can that be?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<+-> Not only strengths are merged but weaknesses as well
			\item<+-> Strengths and weaknesses average out
		\end{itemize}
		\item<+-> Can this be improved?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<+-> In our case, each base learner had an equal weight
			\item<+-> Improve the results by changing the weights
			\item<+-> Emphasize strengths of one classifier (e.g. high recall
			of Na\"ive Bayes), mitigate weaknesses of another
		\end{itemize}
