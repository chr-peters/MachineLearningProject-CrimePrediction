  \begin{itemize}
    \item<+-> The authors of \cite{indian} developed a similar approach
      \begin{itemize}
        \item<+-> Same dataset
        \item<+-> Only Na\"ive Bayes and Decision Tree
        \item<+-> Feature selection based on subjective choice
        \item<+-> No details disclosed regarding their method of assigning the
          class labels
      \end{itemize}
    \item<+-> A different approach is illustrated in \cite{forecast}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item<+-> Goal: predict crime hotspots in the US
        \item<+-> They first mapped unique crime records to the
          corresponding locations of the US using geographical coordinates
        \item<+-> Their next step was to find clusters
        \item<+-> The prediction of crime activity within the clusters was
          performed by an artificial neural network
      \end{itemize}
