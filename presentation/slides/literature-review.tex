A similar approach to ours was already developed by the authors of
\cite{indian} who employed "WEKA" for predicting the crime category
using the same data as well. In order to do this, they selected a
different set of features which is omitted here for the sake of saving
space. Their method of selection as well as the assignment of the
class labels "High", "Medium" and "Low" to each instance in the
dataset is -- countrary to our approach -- solely based on subjective
choice.

In order to perform the classification task, they chose two
classifiers, namely a Na\"ive Bayesian and a decision tree. They did
however use the same evaluation metrics as used in this paper, which
allows for comparison of the different approaches.\\


\noindent In contrast to those ways of predicting crime there is a
different approach illustrated in \cite{forecast}. In order to predict
crime in the future they analyzed a dataset which contains the
following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-2pt}
	\item Time
	\item Day
	\item Month
	\item Weather
	\item Location(geographical coordinates) 
\end{itemize}
The records in the dataset are geographically mapped onto the certain
regions of the United States of America. Using their own
implementation of a cluster analysis they detect hot-spots of crime
according to the given features. Afterwards an artificial neural
network tries to forecast crime activity in the future.
