In a time of limited resources regarding fighting crimes, we aim to predict the crime category of different
cities to provide additional guidance when distributing those resources.

To emphasize the influence of certain factors on the criminal rates of cities, we use different
classifiers to predict the criminal category (i.e. high, medium and low) the city falls into. The classifiers
employed are namely k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Na\"ive Bayes Classifier and Neural Network.
After training each classifier on its own, the obtained models are combined into an ensemble, the decision of
which is based on a majority vote. This is done to achieve even better results.

In order to evaluate the results, we use the common evaluation metrics e.g accuracy, recall, precision and
f-measure.

In the course of this research the open source data mining software WEKA is used to apply the algorithms to
the dataset.
