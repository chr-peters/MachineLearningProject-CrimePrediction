\section{Introduction}

To emphasize the influence of certain factors on the criminal rates of cities, we use different classifiers to predict the criminal category (e.g. high, low, medium) the city falls into. 

The classifiers employed are namely k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naive Bayer Classifier, Neural Network, \ldots. 

After training each classifier on its own the obtained models are combined into an ensemble, the decision of which is based on a majority vote, to achieve even better results. 

To evaluate the result we use the common evaluation metrics  e.g accuracy, recall, precision.

In the course of this research the open source data mining software WEKA is used to apply the algorithms to the datasets.
