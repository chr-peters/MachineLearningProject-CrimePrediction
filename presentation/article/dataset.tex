\section{Dataset}

In the course of this research we use real crime data which can be obtained from Machine Learning Repository\footnote{blablabla}.

From the 128 attribute the dataset provides, only the most significant (continuous) features are chosen:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-2pt}
	\item population for community
	\item Median household income
	\item Median family income
	\item Per capita income
	\item Num. of people under poverty level
	\item Percentage of people 25 and over with less than a 9th grade education
	\item Percentage of people 25 and over that are not high school graduates
	\item Percentage of people 25 and over in the labor force, and unemployed
	\item Percentage of people 25 and over who are employed
	\item Total number of violent crimes per 100K population
\end{itemize}

The goal is to predict the crime category, which is an artificial attribute based on the total number of violent crimes per 100K population. This class is divided into high, medium and low.
