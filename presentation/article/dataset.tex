\section{Dataset}

This research is based on real crime data which can be obtained from the Machine Learning
Repository\footnote{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime}. The dataset contains 1994 instances. The whole set consists of a union of three subsets, namely the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.

From the 128 attributes the dataset provides, only the most significant features are chosen which are all
continuous in nature:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-2pt}
	\item population 
	\item mean people per household
	\item percentage of population that is african american
	\item percentage of population that is caucasian
	\item percentage of population that is of asian heritage 
	\item percentage of population that is of hispanic heritage
	\item percentage of population that is 16-24 in age
	\item percentage of population that is 65 and over in age 
	\item median household income
	\item percentage of people under the poverty level
	\item percentage of people 25 and over with less than a 9th grade education 
	\item percentage of people 16 and over, in the labor force, and unemployed 
	\item percentage of population who are divorced
	\item percent of people who do not speak English well 
	\item population density in persons per square mile
	\item total number of violent crimes per 100K population 
\end{itemize}

The goal is to predict the crime category, which is an
\textit{artificial}\footnote{this attribute is added by us}, discrete and ordinal attribute.
The values of this attributes, i.e.
the classes that are to be predicted, are obtained by clustering the attribute "total number of violent
crimes per 100K population" into three labels: "high", "medium" and "low". To accomplish this, we use an
unsupervised learning approach, namely k-Means clustering.

For predicting the "crime category", the attribute "total number of violent crimes per 100K population" is
removed from the dataset, because it is already represented by the class division and would harm the ability
of the classifier to draw conclusions from other relevant attributes.
